1.Create a VPC
  Go to VPC → Your VPCs → Create VPC
  Name: ec2-vpc-project
  IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  Create VPC.
2.Create Public Subnets
  Go to Subnets → Create subnet
  Select ec2-vpc-project.
  Create two subnets (for high availability), 
      e.g.:10.0.1.0/24 – public-subnet-1
           10.0.2.0/24 – public-subnet-2
  After creation, for each public subnet:
  Select subnet → Actions → Edit subnet settings → Enable Auto-assign public IPv4
3.Create and Attach Internet Gateway
  Go to Internet Gateways → Create internet gateway.
  Name: ec2-igw.
  Create, then Attach to VPC → choose ec2-vpc-project.
4.Configure Route Table for Public Subnets
  Go to Route tables.
  Either use the main route table or create a new one named public-rt.
  In Routes tab → Edit routes:
    Add route:
      Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
      Target: your Internet Gateway (ec2-igw)
  In Subnet associations → Edit subnet associations:
  Select public-subnet-1 and public-subnet-2.
  Now anything in these subnets can reach the internet.
5.Create Security Groups
  a) Load Balancer Security Group – elb-sg
      Go to EC2 → Security Groups → Create security group.
      Name: elb-sg, VPC: ec2-vpc-project.
      Inbound rules:
      HTTP, Port 80, Source: 0.0.0.0/0.
      Outbound: leave default (all allowed).
  b) EC2 Security Group – ec2-web-sg
      Create another SG: ec2-web-sg, same VPC.
      Inbound rules:
      HTTP, Port 80, Source: elb-sg (choose “Custom” → search by SG name).
      (Optional) SSH, Port 22, Source: Your IP only.
      Outbound: default (all allowed)
6.Launch EC2 Instance
  Go to EC2 → Instances → Launch instance.
  Name: web-server-1.
  AMI: Amazon Linux 2 (free tier).
  Instance type: t2.micro.
  Key pair: select your key pair.
  Network:
  VPC: ec2-vpc-project
  Subnet: public-subnet-1
  Auto-assign public IP: enabled
  Security group: choose ec2-web-sg.
  Under Advanced details → User data,
          #!/bin/bash
          yum update -y
          yum install -y httpd
          systemctl enable httd
          systemctl start httpd
          echo "<h1>Welcome from EC2 in VPC behind ELB</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  Launch instance and wait until state is running and 2/2 checks passed.
7.Create Target Group
  Go to EC2 → Target Groups → Create target group.
  Target type: Instances.
  Name: web-tg.
  Protocol: HTTP, Port: 80.
  VPC: ec2-vpc-project.
  Health check path: / (default is fine).
  Next → Register targets:
    Select your EC2 instance → Include as pending below → Create target group.
8.Create Application Load Balancer
  Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Create load balancer.
  Choose Application Load Balancer.
  Name: ec2-alb.
  Scheme: Internet-facing.
  IP type: IPv4.
  Network mapping:
    VPC: ec2-vpc-project
    Select both public-subnet-1 and public-subnet-2.
  Security groups: select elb-sg.
  Listeners:
    Protocol: HTTP, Port: 80
    Default action: forward to web-tg target group.
  Create load balancer.
  Wait until State: active.
9.Verify Everything
  In Target Groups → web-tg, check that your instance status is healthy.
  In Load Balancers, copy the DNS name, e.g.:
           ec2-alb-1234567890.region.elb.amazonaws.com
  Paste into a browser.
  You should see:
          “Welcome from EC2 in VPC behind ELB”

If you add a second instance and refresh, ALB will round-robin between them.
